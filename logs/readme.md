# logs

This directory contains log files generated by the fsenrollment-pssync application.

## Important Notes

- Log files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- This directory is preserved in the repository for structure
- Logs are created automatically during script execution

## Log Management

### Log Levels

The application should support standard log levels:
- **Debug**: Detailed diagnostic information
- **Info**: General informational messages
- **Warning**: Warning messages for potentially harmful situations
- **Error**: Error events that might still allow the application to continue

### Log Rotation

Implement log rotation to manage disk space:
- Maximum log file size (e.g., 10 MB)
- Log retention period (e.g., 30 days)
- Automatic archival of old logs

### Log Format

Logs should include:
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
- Log level
- Component/function name
- Message
- Additional context (user, session ID, etc.)

Example log entry:
```
2025-10-13T17:26:00.000Z [INFO] Sync-PowerSchoolData: Starting synchronization process
2025-10-13T17:26:01.234Z [DEBUG] Import-CsvFile: Processing file: students_2025-10-13.csv
2025-10-13T17:26:02.456Z [ERROR] Invoke-PowerSchoolApi: API call failed with status 429 (Rate Limit)
```

## Security Considerations

- Ensure logs do not contain sensitive data (passwords, API keys, SSNs, etc.)
- Sanitize or mask sensitive information before logging
- Restrict file permissions on log files
- Consider encrypting logs if they contain PII
